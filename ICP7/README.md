# ICP7 Work

In this ICP I've learned about backend connections and CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) Operations. For this I've used mongodb.

## Initial Steps

For this Icp i've installed mongodb and made a local connection and stored data and when the application is started both front-end data and back-end data communicates with each other. Unlike regular angular application to run the output we need to use ** npm run start ** which starts both front-end and back-end. For reference you can go through the scripts section in package.json file.

# Outputs

## Connection established to the data and application started running.
